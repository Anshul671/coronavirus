	<h1>How long will the coronavirus last</h1>
	<p>It's too soon to tell how long the pandemic will continue.It depends on many things,including researchers' work to learn more about the virus,their search for a treatment and a vaccine,and the public's efforts to slow the spread.More than 100 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development and testing.This process usually takes years.Researchers are speeding it up as much as they can,and some vaccines are already in late-stage trials.While some say we could have a vaccine by year's end,others predict it will be longer to ensure that the vaccine works,is safe,and can be distributed widely.</p>
